For separator option, check only "," (Comma), and text encoding must be set to utf-8. When you will be saving the file, choose "csv" format. Same with exporting (<b>Don't forget to set UTF-8 + "," comma as separator</b>), <b>if you need help, contact me at "donislawdev@gmail.com".</b>

Translation don't need to look the same, we mainly focus on the meaning.
